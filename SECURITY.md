## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. Please do not report any potential security issue publicly, 
either on the community site or through a public issue tracker. Instead, drop an email 
to the security inbox where it can be discussed privately. We'll work with you to 
verify the issue and put a fix in place.
