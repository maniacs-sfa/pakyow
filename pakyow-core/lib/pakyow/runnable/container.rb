    # Runs and manages one or more services.
    #
    # = Management Strategy
    #
    # Processes are managed with one of two strategies:
    #
    #   * `:forked` - Each service runs in a fork of the current service.
    #
    #   * `:threaded` - Each service runs in a thread within the current service.
    #
    # Forked is the default strategy, falling back to Threaded on platforms that don't support fork.
    # The strategy can be specified explicitly by passing the `:strategy` runtime option.
    #
    # It's expected that only one container is running per process or thread.
    #
    # = Automatic Restarts
    #
    # Containers are restartable by default, meaning they run until stopped. In practice, this means
    # that if one or all container services exit, the container will automatically restart them.
    #
    # Automatic restarts can be disabled for containers at runtime by passing `restartable: false`
    # as a run option. Restartability can be completely disabled for a container by defining the
    # container with `restartable: false`:
    #
    #   Pakyow.container :some_container, restartable: false do
    #     ..
    #   end
    #
    # If the container is defined as unrestartable, the `:restartable` runtime option is ignored.
    #
    # = Failed Process Backoffs
    #
    # If a restartable service fails, it will be restarted using an exponential backoff. The backoff
    # time is calculated by multiplying the time it took the service to fail by the current retry
    # count. Container will always wait at least 500 milliseconds before restarting a service, even
    # if the service failed immediately.
    #
    # = Signal Handling
    #
    # Containers handle these service signals for you:
    #
    #   * `INT`: Stops the container, giving its services an opportunity to shutdown.
    #
    #   * `TERM`: Stops the container without waiting on its services to shutdown.
    #
    #   * `HUP`: Restarts the container along with its services.
    #
    # = Formations
    #
    # Containers can be run with a formation specifying which services to run. If a formation is
    # unspecified, a single instance of all services are run.
    #
    # Run all services with service-defined counts:
    #
    #   Pakyow.container(:some_container).run(formation: Pakyow::Runnable::Formation.all)
    #
    # Specify a formation by passing a formation object through the `:formation` run option.
    #
    # Run 3 instances of all services:
    #
    #   Pakyow.container(:some_container).run(formation: Pakyow::Runnable::Formation.all(3))
    #
    # Run 3 instances of `service_1` and 1 instance of `service_2`:
    #
    #   Pakyow.container(:some_container).run(formation: Pakyow::Runnable::Formation.build { |formation|
    #     formation.run(:service_1, 3)
    #     formation.run(:service_2, 1)
    #   })
    #
    # If a service is unspecified in a formation, it will not be run.
    #
    # = Nested Container Behavior
    #
    # Containers assume they are running as a top-level container. When running a container within
    # another service, pass the service as the `parent` option. This tells the container that it is
    # running as a nested container. Prerun / Postrun methods won't be called on services running in
    # a nested container and the container will report its status to the parent service.
