#
# = Configuration
#
# The environment can be configured
#
#   Pakyow.configure do
#     config.server.port = 2001
#   end
#
# It's possible to configure environments differently.
#

#
# = Hooks
#
# Hooks can be defined for the following events:
#
#   - load
#   - configure
#   - setup
#   - boot
#   - shutdown
#   - run
#
# Here's how to log a message after boot:
#
#   Pakyow.after "boot" do
#     logger.info "booted"
#   end
#
# @see Support::Hookable
#
# = Logging
#
# The environment contains a global general-purpose logger. It also provides
# a {RequestLogger} instance to each app for logging during a request.
#
# = Setup & Running
#
# The environment can be setup and then run.
#
#   Pakyow.setup(env: :development).run
