You may also see some of the following files and folders in your project:

| File&nbsp;or&nbsp;Folder | Overview                                  |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `bin/`                   | Binstubs for running scripts in context of your project. |
| `tmp/`                   | Temporary files like caches. |
| `Gemfile.lock`           | Snapshot of your project's dependencies. |
| `Procfile`               | Defines the processes needed to run your project in production. |

These are internal files for Pakyow and its dependencies. It's rare you'll ever need to touch these files, but leave them in place so things work properly.
