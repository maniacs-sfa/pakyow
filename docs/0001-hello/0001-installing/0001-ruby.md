title: Installing Ruby
---

If your system has an older version of Ruby—or Ruby isn't installed at all—this guide will help get you going. We've included instructions for the most popular operating systems below.

*If you're running macOS:*

1. [Install Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (we'll wait here)
2. Open a terminal and run this command:

```
brew install ruby
```

*If you're running Linux:*

Install Ruby with `apt` or `yum` depending on your distribution.

For Debian, Ubuntu, and Mint flavors, open a terminal and run this command:

```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ruby
```

For CentOS, RedHat, and Fedora, open a terminal and run this command:

```
sudo yum install ruby
```

For anything else, we'll trust you know what to do.

*If you're running Windows:*

Ruby isn't quite as well supported on Windows, but it's still possible to setup a local development environment. We recommend using the [RubyInstaller](https://rubyinstaller.org/) to install Ruby on Windows.

Once Ruby is installed on your system, run this command to install Pakyow:

```
gem install pakyow
```

If the command succeeds, you're ready to go!
