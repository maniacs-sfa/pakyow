title: Before you start
---

If you haven't already, [take a minute to install Pakyow](doc:hello/installing). We'll wait here.

Once Pakyow is installed, generate a project using `pakyow create` from the command line:

```
pakyow create example
```

Pakyow creates a brand new project structure for you and gets it ready to run.

From the command line, move into your new project folder:

```
cd example
```

You're ready to start building!
