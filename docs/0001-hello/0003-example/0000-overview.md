title: 5-Minute App
---

Welcome! We're glad you're interested in learning learning about Pakyow. The best way to get a feel for everything is to build something yourself. This guide will take you through the entire design-first process, starting with a frontend prototype and then turning the prototype into a complete application.

You'll be building a simple messaging app that lets users create messages and send replies to each other. There's nothing you need to know before going through this guide. It's intended to be approachable by anyone, even if you've never built a web app before. If you do get stuck, feel free to reach out to the community. We're happy to help!
