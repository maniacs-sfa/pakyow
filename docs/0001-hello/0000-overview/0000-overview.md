title: Hello, Web

Pakyow is a web framework that helps you turn your html into a complete web app. Years ago we set out to design a better way to build for the web. Here's the result&mdash;a full stack of open-source frameworks that offers a simple, design-first approach. We want to help you do more with what you already know, whether you're just starting out or have been building for the web for years.

Here's how it works:

1. **Prototype:** Create an in-browser prototype without writing any backend code. Use composable, plain-html view templates to define how your app looks and behaves, then sprinkle data bindings on top to describe the semantic intent behind your interface.

2. **Reflect:** While you prototype, Pakyow reflects on your views to bootstrap a complete backend to make your interface work&mdash;including routes, data models, presenters, and more. The reflection integrates seamlessly with your frontend, giving you a solid foundation to continue building on.

3. **Iterate:** With the boilerplate taken care of, focus on building what makes your app unique. Any custom code you add runs right alongside the reflection, giving you flexibility where you need it and a secure, standards-based fallback for everything else.
