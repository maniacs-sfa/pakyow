title: Integrating reflection with your backend
---

Reflection will take your project pretty far, but most projects will probably hit a point where custom behavior is needed. For example, user authentication isn't something you can do with reflection since it relies on more complex behavior such as session management.

If and when you hit the point of needing custom code, you can continue to use Reflection just as you were up to that point. All of the reflected behavior integrates seamlessly with any custom behavior you add, helping where it can but backing off when you decide to take over.

Our goal is to keep you from writing boilerplate and focused on what makes your project unique.
