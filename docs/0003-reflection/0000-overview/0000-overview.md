title: Reflection
---

Most web applications share quite a bit of common code, or boilerplate. When building an application, a significant amount of time is spent connecting various aspects together and writing code to perform the same work over and over. Not only is this time consuming, it means there's a lot more you have to know before you can build something.

Pakyow includes a feature called Reflection that takes care of the boilerplate for you. As you define your interface with view templates, Reflection bootstraps custom backend behavior that powers your frontend. The reflection handles things like presenting dynamic data from a database, defining actions for creating and changing data, and setting up navigation between pages of your application. You can even use the reflection in production!

What this means is that you can build a working, production-ready application just by writing a little bit of HTML. With the boilerplate taken care of, you're free to focus on the features that make your application unique.
