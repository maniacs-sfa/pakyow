Pakyow is released free and open-source under the terms of the LGPLv3 license. We offer paid team subscriptions that remove some of the restrictions of the LGPL. Team subscriptions also include access to expert help through a private support channel.

Giving Pakyow away for free and charging for the extra bits on top lets us embrace the open-source ethos in a responsible and sustainable way. Pakyow is our full-time job&mdash;we're in this for the long haul.
