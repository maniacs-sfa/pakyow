title: Configuration
---

Pakyow ships fully configured with the most useful conventions for most projects. These conventions let you hit the ground running by reducing the number of decisions you need to make. But the framework shouldn't tie your hands, so we've designed the framework to be highly configurable to your specific needs.

There are two main areas of configuration: the **application** and the **environment** where the application runs. These configuration files can be found at `./config/application.rb` and `./conifg/environment.rb` respectively.
