title: Protecting from cross-site forgery
---

Pakyow protects your forms with built in cross-site forgery protection. It does this by rendering the form with a special token tied to the user's session. When submitted, the token value is checked for authenticity. If it's authentic, the form submission is allowed in to the backend application. Otherwise, the form submission will be rejected and an errored response will be sent back down to the web browser.
