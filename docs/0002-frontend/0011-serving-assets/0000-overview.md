title: Serving Assets
---

Pakyow provides an asset pipeline for managing all of the your project's assets, including stylesheets, scripts, images, and fonts. It replaces complex build pipelines and toolchains with a natural approach to organizing and using assets.

Assets that are part of the managed pipeline live in the `frontend/assets` folder. The one exception to this is assets that are composed with view templates. You can read more about composed assets in this guide.

How you organize your assets within the assets folder is up to you. Generated applications include a default structure with folders for your images, stylesheets, and scripts. But do what works for you!
