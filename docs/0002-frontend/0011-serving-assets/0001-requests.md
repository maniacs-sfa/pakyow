title: Making asset requests
---

Pakyow exposes your assets the same way they are defined in the `frontend/assets` folder, making asset paths fairly predictable. If you're using default configuration values, the assets folder is mounted at the `/assets` request path. This means that an image named `logo.png` placed in the images folder is served at `/assets/images/logo.png`.
