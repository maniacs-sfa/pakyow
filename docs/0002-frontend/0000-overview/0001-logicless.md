title: Logicless view templates
---

Pakyow view templates are written using plain, standards-based HTML and don't contain any presentation logic. Everything else, from the behavior of ui components or the logic behind presenting a view template, is defined outside of the view template itself.

Think of it as a form of progressive enhancement. The view templates describe their intent, and these intents are fulfilled by other parts of the application as they are available in the framework or supported by the end-user's web browser. In the end, views templates remain standalone building blocks of your application.
