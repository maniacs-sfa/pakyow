title: Frontend prototypes

Separating the frontend and backend gives us the unique ability to boot a project without the backend being attached. When running in prototype mode, the frontend interface will still be rendered, giving you a predictable place to focus on frontend design work.

You can load any view template along with its assets from a web browser. The prototype is fully navigable, and Pakyow provides tools on top of the prototype to help see the interface in every possible state.

We think the best place to design a website or web app is in the browser itself. Taking this approach moves your ideas from the theoretical space, helping you make more pragmatic decisions. It forces you to think more about the problems from an end-user perspective, while being realistic about how easy or difficult a feature will be to build.
