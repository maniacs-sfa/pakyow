title: Using Sass & Scss
---

To write your stylesheets in Sass or Scss, simply replace the .css extension with .sass or .scss. Pakyow will walk you through installing any necessary dependencies, then process these assets on demand.

> [callout] When referencing preprocessed assets in your view templates, always use the extension the asset will be compiled to. For example, if you have a Sass asset located at `frontend/assets/styles/example.sass`, reference it like this:
>
> ```html
> <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/assets/styles/example.css">
> ```
