title: Using the prototype bar
---

Pakyow adds a prototype bar to projects running in prototype mode. It provides a control you can use to place the current view into one of its defined modes. This helps you design all of the various states your users will see the interface in.

Here's a screenshot of the pakyow.com homepage running in prototype mode:

You'll see with the prototype bar in the bottom right hand corner of the screen.
