title: Prototyped elements
---

It's sometimes helpful to populate the prototype with more elements than the application will ultimately need. Anything that should be removed outside of the prototype can be labeled with the `prototype` attribute:

```html
<div prototype>
  I'll show up in the prototype, but not outside of it.
</div>
```
