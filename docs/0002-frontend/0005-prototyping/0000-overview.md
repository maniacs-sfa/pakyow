title: Prototyping
---

Prototyping is a powerful aspect of Pakyow's design-first process. If you can write basic html markup you can quickly build a prototype of your application that's accessible from any web browser.

The prototype becomes a living part of your project. Because Pakyow enforces a clear separation between the frontend and backend of your application, you can boot back into into the prototype even after the rest of the application has been added on top. This is called "prototype mode".

Prototype mode gives you a predictable place to design a new feature or redesign an existing interface. When running in prototype mode, the backend for your application is effectively turned off, so only your view templates and assets will be served. The prototype is still navigable even without the backend, giving you an idea of what the experience will be for a real user.
