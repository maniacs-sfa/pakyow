Pakyow lets you define frontend view templates and assets in separate parts that are composed together to build a complete interface. This guide explores the various types of view and asset templates and how they're composed together to build a complete view.

Pakyow implements a dynamic templating engine using native HTML. This means that you're to create complete interfaces just by defining templates. There's no coding requiredâ€”in fact you'll never leave the `frontend` folder!
