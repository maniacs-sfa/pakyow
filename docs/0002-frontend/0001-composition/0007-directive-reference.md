title: Directive reference
---

Here's a full list of frontend directives you'll use in your view templates:

* `@container`: Defines a default or named container in a layout.
* `@within`: Defines content for a named container in a page.
* `@include`: Includes a partial into another view template.

Each directive is placed inside an HTML comment, like this:

```html
<!-- @container -->
```
